      "1. Explain risk, vulnerability and threat? \n",
      "TIP: A good way to start this answer is by explaining vulnerability, and threat and then risk. Back this \n",
      "up with an easy to understand example. \n",
      " \n",
      "Vulnerability (weakness) is a gap in the protection efforts of a system, a threat is an attacker who \n",
      "exploits that weakness. Risk is the measure of potential loss when that the vulnerability is exploited \n",
      "by the threat e.g. Default username and password for a server – An attacker can easily crack into this \n",
      "server and compromise it (Here's a resource that will navigate you through cyber security attacks). \n",
      "2. What is the difference between Asymmetric and Symmetric \n",
      "encryption and which one is better? \n",
      " \n",
      "Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, while Asymmetric \n",
      "encryption uses different keys for encryption and decryption. \n",
      " \n",
      "Symmetric is usually much faster but the key needs to be transferred over an unencrypted channel. \n",
      " \n",
      "Asymmetric on the other hand is more secure but slow. Hence, a hybrid approach should be \n",
      "preferred. Setting up a channel using asymmetric encryption and then sending the data using \n",
      "symmetric process. \n",
      "3. What is an IPS and how does it differs from IDS? \n",
      "IDS is an intrusion detection system whereas an IPS is an intrusion prevention system. IDS will just \n",
      "detect the intrusion and will leave the rest to the administrator for further action whereas an IPS will \n",
      "detect the intrusion and will take further action to prevent the intrusion. Another difference is the \n",

      "placement is different. \n",
      "4. What is XSS, how will you mitigate it? \n",
      "Cross site scripting is a JavaScript vulnerability in the web applications. The easiest way to explain \n",
      "this is a case when a user enters a script in the client side input fields and that input gets processed \n",
      "without getting validated. This leads to untrusted data getting saved and executed on the client side. \n",
      " \n",
      "Countermeasures of XSS are input validation, implementing a CSP (Content security policy) etc (Also \n",

      "5. What is the difference between encryption and hashing? \n",
      "Point 1: Encryption is reversible whereas hashing is irreversible. Hashing can be cracked using \n",
      "rainbow tables and collision attacks but is not reversible. \n",
      "Point 2: Encryption ensures confidentiality whereas hashing ensures Integrity. \n",
      "6. Are you a coder/developer or know any coding languages? \n",

      " \n",
      "Cross Site Request Forgery is a web application vulnerability in which the server does not check \n",

      "8. What is a Security Misconfiguration? \n",
      " \n",
      "Security misconfiguration is a vulnerability when a device/application/network is configured in a way \n",
      "which can be exploited by an attacker to take advantage of it. This can be as simple as leaving the \n",

      "systems work on the similar lines. It’s just that the placement in different. HIDS is placed on each \n",
